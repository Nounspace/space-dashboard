The nounspace Community Treasury has admin power on both the $SPACE Distribution contract as well as the User and Developer pools. While Nounspace governance is powered by SnapShot and occurs offchain (no gas cost to vote), the treasury is powered by Safe and oSnap. oSnap, powered by Uma, enables $SPACE holders to execute transactions included in SnapShot proposals autonomously. At launch, the Based Space Foundation will manage the treasury via a 3/6 multisig, but the community has the power to update or remove the multisig autonomously at any point via governance."
